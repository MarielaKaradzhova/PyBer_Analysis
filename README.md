## Purpose of Project
The purpose of this project is to explore and analyze ride-sharing data from a large dataset with the goal of improving access to ride-sharing services. Second, this project aims to determine affordability for underserviced neighbourhoods, and to provide acessible and affordable transportation where needed.

## Overview of Statistical Analysis
### Resources
Data Source: https://github.com/MarielaKaradzhova/PyBer_Analysis/tree/main/Resources

Software: Python 3.7.6, Jupyter Notebook 6.1.4
Python Tools: pandas, Matplotlib

This analysis was performed using Jupyter Notebook, an open-sourced web application that allows users to create and share documents  with code, quations, visualizations and text. The exploratory analysis of this project contains dataframes created from a much larger dataset (see the Resources folder for original data sources), which includes statistics from different cities, dates, numbers of drivers, fare costs, numbers of rides and numbers of users. The goal of this analysis was to obtain summary statistics between the type of city,  number of drivers and riders, and the percentage of total fares, drivers and riders per city type.
